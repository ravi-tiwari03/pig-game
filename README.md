# PIG-GAME
A small and fun game implemented in Javascript
Two player game(can be extended upto 6)
A player in its turn can roll the dice as many times as he wants to but as soon as he rolls 1 he looses his current Round score and then its the next player's turn. A player can also hold its Round score by clicking the hold button and then his round score gets added to player's global score. The player who scores >= 100 first, wins the game.
